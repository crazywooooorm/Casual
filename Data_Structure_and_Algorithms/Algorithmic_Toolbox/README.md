* Greatest common divisor * Least common multiple = Number_a * Number_b, it's easy to show.
* For any integer m >= 2, Fibonacci series mod m is periodic, the period always starts with 0, 1 and is known as Pisano period.  
* Sum of Fibonacci series is also a Fibonacci-like series, it's easy to show.
