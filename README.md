见贤思齐焉，见不贤而内自省也。

Life is distributed randomly. knowledge is infinite. Recorde as much as I can. Build the structure from chaos.

This repo stores all the casual stuff. I will try to list all the points here.

### Updates
#### 07/20/18
Finished most of the python basic train. Basically we did some practice on data structure, functional programming and object oriented programming. In the last part we haven't touched those magic methods. In future, we might learn more about I/O development and modules.
