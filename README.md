# Casual
见贤思齐焉，见不贤而内自省也。

Life is distributed randomly. knowledge is infinite. Recorde as much as I can. Build the structure from chaos.

This repo stores all the casual stuff. I will try to list all the points here.

### Updates
#### 07/20/18
Finished most of the python basic train. Basically we did some practice on data structure, functional programming and object oriented programming. In the last part we haven't touched those magic methods. In future, we might learn more about I/O development and modules.

#### 07/29/18
Finished the Searching and Sorting part in Algorithms & Data Structures. Quick Sort and Merge Sort are the most complicated algorithms for me, but also have a higher efficiency than other sorting algorithms.

#### 08/07/18
Still have search tree part left in tree structure. The reason I stopped is that I feel too much data structure practice only increase the knowledge rather than the true algorithm insights. I think more practice on algorithms is necessary, so in next period I shall focus more on the algorithm practice.
