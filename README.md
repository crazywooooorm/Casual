# Casual
袖里珍奇光五色，他年要补天西北。

Life is distributed randomly. knowledge is infinite. Recorde as much as I can. Build the structure from chaos.

This repo stores all the casual stuff. I will try to list all the points here.

### Recent book list

### Updates
#### 07/20/18
Finished most of the python basic train. Basically we did some practice on data structure, functional programming and object oriented programming. In the last part we haven't touched those magic methods. In future, we might learn more about I/O development and modules.

#### 07/29/18
Finished the Searching and Sorting part in Algorithms & Data Structures. Quick Sort and Merge Sort are the most complicated algorithms for me, but also have a higher efficiency than other sorting algorithms.

#### 08/07/18
Still have search tree part left in tree structure. The reason I stopped is that I feel too much data structure practice only increase the knowledge rather than the true algorithm insights. I think more practice on algorithms is necessary, so in next period I shall focus more on the algorithm practice.

#### 08/30/18
The algorithm practice took more time than I expected. Just finished the Divide & Conquer. Greedy algorithm is easy to catch, but when implementing a Divide & Conquer algorithm we need to be really careful on the recursion control. Don't mess up if and while; and always make it clear the division happens on the target list or only on the index.

#### 09/10/18
Finished the whole algorithm toolbox. Last chapter Dynamic Programming is the most difficult chapter. To implement a dynamic programming algorithm, firstly, figure out what can be split and in each step what operations can be done. Then start loop from the smallest subgroup and use something to store those results.

Next, we might do some practice on data structures.
